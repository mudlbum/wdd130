    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2>Bumyol Lee</h2>
    <h2>AKA Dave</h2>
    <p>I have been working in the IT field but haven't been able to earn a related degree.</p>
    <p>I love playing basketball but ever since I injured my back, I haven't been able to play.</p>
    <p>However, I still have computer to play with. So I don't get board these days without basketball</p>
    <p>I am blessed with three children and I am currently working in a company as a IT manager.</p>
    <p>I am pursuing for a computer science degree in BYU idaho</p>
    <p>Hopefully BS but at least AA. I am taking this course because it was one of the course that was part of my major</p>
    <p>I figured it would be good to take this course because it can be very usefull also.</p>
    <p>I do not have specific quote from a church leader that is my favorite. However, I do love the Alma 32:27.</p>
    <p>It is well known scripture that encourages us to be stronger when there is a hard time.</p>
